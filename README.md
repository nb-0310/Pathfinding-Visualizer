# Pathfinding-Visualizer

A tool to visualize several pathfinding algorithms and maze generation algorithms on a graph.

## Overview
Pathfinding-Visualizer is a web-based tool that allows you to visualize various pathfinding algorithms and maze generation algorithms on a graph. It provides an interactive interface to understand and analyze the performance of different algorithms in finding paths and generating mazes. You can view the live demo [here](https://nb-0310.github.io/Pathfinding-Visualizer/).

## Features
- Algorithm visualization: Select from a variety of pathfinding algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm, breadth first search and depth first search and see how they operate on the graph in real-time.
- Real-time animations: Observe the step-by-step process of each algorithm as it explores the graph, highlights visited nodes, and discovers the shortest path.
- Maze generation: Generate randomized mazes using recursive backtracking, providing challenging environments for pathfinding algorithms to navigate.

## Usage
To use Pathfinding-Visualizer, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine:
